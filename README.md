# Pulse-Roblox-External-
Source code of the pulse roblox external, outdated and most likely detected, new offsets and driver needed for safe functionality, feature rich.

Unfortunately, the source is needed to be posted on a 3rd party uploader site due to githubs restrictions, alonside added is another overlay for pulse that can be used.

For any information contact zr.11 on discord

I forgot to add this, however it does use a custom auth. F1 is used to open the menu
